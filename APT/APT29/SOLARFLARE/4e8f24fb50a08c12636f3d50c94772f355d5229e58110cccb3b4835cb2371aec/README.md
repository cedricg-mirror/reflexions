Analysed sample is a 64bit malware attributed by the CISA to APT29 and named SOLARFLARE by FireEye.  

Runtime analysis results are shared in two files :  

- logs.txt which contains a full execution trace of the malware until it awaits a C2 connection  
- conf.txt which is the setup that used for this sample, it contains notably the list of API calls which have been filtered out from the log  


*** Commentary *** 

Analyzed sample contains a few point of interest :

---- 

Wine detection :  

```html
[ * ] [pid 0xb28][tid 0xb24] c:\users\user\desktop\solar_flare\go.exe

[RET] 0x4640de in [go.exe]
```  


---- 

As illustrated in the following code sequence, almost all API call have the same return address :  

```html

[RET] 0x4640de ðŸ¡„ðŸ¡„ðŸ¡„ 
```

Below, the stub where all API call are directed :  

```asm

0033:004640b9 mov     rcx,qword ptr [rsi]  
0033:004640bc mov     rdx,qword ptr [rsi+8]  
0033:004640c0 mov     r8,qword ptr [rsi+10h]  
0033:004640c4 mov     r9,qword ptr [rsi+18h]  
0033:004640c8 movd    xmm0,rcx  
0033:004640cd movd    xmm1,rdx  
0033:004640d2 movd    xmm2,r8  
0033:004640d7 movd    xmm3,r9  
0033:004640dc call    rax  
0033:004640de add     rsp, 0x80  ; <----- 004640de : return address from most function call
0033:004640e5 pop     rcx  
0033:004640e6 mov     qword ptr [rcx+18h],rax  
0033:004640ea mov     rdi,qword ptr gs:[30h]  
0033:004640f3 mov     eax,dword ptr [rdi+68h]  
0033:004640f6 mov     qword ptr [rcx+28h],rax  
0033:004640fa ret  
```

This design hinders manual analysis but also create a single point of 'weakness' where it becomes possible to hook and supervise / modify most of the malware's activity.

More specificaly, the option requested by setsockopt isn't compatible with the SOCK_STREAM type of the targeted socket and will always fail (error 10042).

The sample attempts a HTTPS (443) connection to the IP associated with the domain "megatoolkit.com" (in this case 169.254.143.42).  
The connection is achieved through a call to the un-exported function MSAFD_ConnectEx from mswsock.dll.  
The address of the un-exported function is retrieved through a call to WSAIotl as demonstrated above.  

This trick may bypass EDR or other kind of userland supervision tool that would rely on hooks on more 'traditional' functions.

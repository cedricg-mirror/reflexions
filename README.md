# reflexions

This repository is meant to share knownledge on malicious code targeting the Windows OS, whether they are state sponsored or cybercrime related.
The focus of my approach beeing dynamic analysis, I will be providing here logs resulting from runtime supervision of malware belonging to various APT/CyberCrime groups.

At this early stage, the logs provided have been designed to be human-readable and do not satisfy any known format that would make them suitable for a machine learning approach.
Log formating will be reworked in a future update of this project.

I do not plan to discuss attribution, samples analyzed here are all coming from public reports from various sources that usually already provide their own insights on that topic.
